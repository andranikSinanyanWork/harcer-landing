From this rural and rather humble\n3. beginning, he later became one of the most famous and beloved\n4. motion-picture producers in history. Although he died in 1966, his\n5. name and artistic legacy continue to influence the lives of millions of\n6. people throughout the world.\n7. After several years of barely making ends meet as a cartoon artist\n8. operating from his Los Angeles garage, Disney had his first success in\n9. 1928, with his release of Mickey Mouse cartoon. Throughout the next\n10. decade, he continued to produce a number of cartoons, and developed\n11. more of his highly profitable and enduring creations, such as Donald\n12. Duck and Pluto. In the late 1930s, he issued the first full-length\n13. cartoon film. Snow White became an instant commercial and critical\n14. success. This was only the first of many films, both animated and not,\n15. produced by Disney and his studio.\n16. But as renowned as Disney name is for cartoons and movies, it is\n17. probably best known for a string of spectacular amusement and theme\n18. parks. Starting with California’s Disneyland in 1955 and culminating\n19. with the fantastically successful Disney World and EPCOT Center in\n20. Florida, Disney became a household name. In recent years, the theme\n21. park concept has become international, with openings in Tokyo and\n22. Paris. With the continuing success of Disney, the creation of future\n23. theme parks is under discussion.",
